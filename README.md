# Woof!
Woof! is an ongoing personal project that started as an assignment. It is a tinder-like application that helps dog owners easily connect with other dog owners and find compatible matches for their pets to socialize safely. The app will allow users to find potential play dates for their dogs. Users will be able to easily see dog profiles and can dislike or like another dog’s profile. If the other dog’s owner likes them back, then you have a match! They can call each other and set up a meeting.
  
## Want to test out the current demo?
The first demo version of this app has already been released! If you'd like to try it out on your phone, check out the releases tab and download and install the .apk onto your android device. To test out functionalities like matching dogs, the Room database is populated for you already with five dummy accounts you can sign into, and you can make more accounts as needed as well. The dummy accounts all use the password `123` and have the following emails:

`jh@jh.com`

`av@av.com`

`ji@ji.com`

`tp@tp.com`

`me@me.com`

You can test out dark mode and light mode view, as well as landscape view. There is currently a bug that will crash the app on landscape view on the matches list but it is available everywhere else on the app.

## Current goals
* Switch from using Room database to using Firestore
* Allow users to change their profile picture
* Change from calling users to using Firestore messaging system
* Encrypt passwords
* Fix landscape view in matches list
* Block duplicate user emails
