# Group Assignment Proposal - Woof!
  Woof! is a tinder-like application that helps dog owners easily connect with other dog owners and find compatible matches for their pets to socialize safely. Aimed at young to middle-aged adults, the app will allow users to find potential play dates for their dogs. Using swipe cards to swipe left or right, users can dislike or like (respectively) another dog’s profile. If the other dog’s owner likes them back, they can call each other and set up a meeting. Here is a list of use cases the app will have:
  - create a dog profile
  - view other profiles
  - swipe left/right on profiles
  - view dog locations (on map)
  - edit dog profile
  - call each other
  - view notifications
